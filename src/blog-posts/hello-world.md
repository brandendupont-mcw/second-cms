District attorneys yield great power to decide who gets a second chance through alternative
programs and who goes through the traditional criminal justice system. DA McCann believes
that community well-being and public safety are sometimes best served when people who do not
present a danger to the public but have committed low-level offenses are given an alternative to
incarceration.


When she became DA, the office had a Juvenile Diversion Program, but not one for adults.
District Attorney McCann launched the office’s Adult Diversion Program in May of 2018. The
primary goals of both the Adult and Juvenile Diversion Programs are to prevent further contact
with the police and criminal justice system, address underlying issues that led to the offense, and
provide a cost-saving alternative to traditional prosecution. The programs provide culturally-
competent services that repair the harm to victims and the community, increase the offenders’
social competency skills, and reduce the likelihood of that persons’ further involvement in the
criminal justice system.


In designing the Adult Diversion Program, it was very important to District Attorney McCann
that the program keep accurate demographic data to ensure that the racial and ethnic
backgrounds of the program participants reflect Denver’s population in the criminal justice
system. As you can see from the dashboard, the racial and ethnic backgrounds of both the adult
and juvenile program participants are reflective of the racial and ethnic population in city’s
criminal justice system.


Moreover, both programs boast impressive recidivism rates: 3% for adults and 5% for juveniles.
It is worth noting that approximately 50% of both adult and juvenile clients received mental
health and/or substance use treatment as part of the diversion programs and upon successful
program completion all participants avoided having a criminal record. The program assists
successful participants in having their records sealed (adults) or expunged (juveniles).
Because of the success of the Adult Diversion Program, and through collaborative partnerships
with various city agencies, the office obtained several grants to expand. Starting in the 2022-
2023 school year, the juvenile program will support a Gang Prevention Coordinator position who
will be present in the Denver Public Schools to help direct young people away from criminal
activity and support healthy lifestyles.


We are very proud of these diversion programs and believe they are an excellent alternative to
the traditional system. These programs prevent future crime and definitely help people make
better choices in their lives that keep them from further contact with the criminal justice system.
