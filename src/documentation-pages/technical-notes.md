### Criminal Legal Terms

<a name="arrest"></a>**Arrest**: Law enforcement takes an individual into legal custody in response to the suspicion of an individual’s violation of the law.

<a name="bail"></a>**Bail or bond:** The amount of money set by the court for the release of a person accused of a crime. It is designed to assure the person's presence for trial and may contain additional non-monetary conditions of release.

### Charge Levels

<a name="felony"></a>**Felony**: Felonies are the most serious criminal violations of Colorado state laws (Colorado Revised Statutes), and include crimes such murder, rape, robbery, and manufacture and delivery of illegal drugs. In Colorado, felonies are divided into six classes, with Class 6 being the lowest level of felony and Class 1 the most serious, with prison sentences ranging from 18 months to life in prison (or death penalty). Sentences following conviction for a felony may include fines, probation, probation plus jail, community corrections, and prison. There are also four classes of drug felonies, with Class 4 being the lowest, and Class 1 the highest, with prison sentences ranging from six months to 32 years in prison.

<a name="misdemeanor"></a>**Misdemeanor**: Misdemeanors are less serious criminal violations of Colorado state laws, punishable by a sentence of up to 18 months in county jail. A person convicted of a misdemeanor cannot be sentenced to state prison, unless the misdemeanor sentence is served simultaneously (concurrently) with a felony sentence. In Colorado, misdemeanor offenses are divided into three classes, with Class 3 being the lowest level of misdemeanor and Class 1 the most serious. Misdemeanors cover a wide range of offenses, including crimes such as serious traffic offenses, alcohol-related traffic offenses (such as DUI and DWAI), careless driving resulting in injury or death, domestic violence, 3rd degree assault, 2nd degree forgery, indecent exposure, obstructing a police officer, theft less than $500, resisting arrest, criminal mischief with less than $500 damage, public fighting, prostitution and soliciting for prostitution, and underage drinking. There are also two classes of drug misdemeanors, DM1 and DM2, where the maximum possible punishment is 18 months.

<a name="petty"></a>**Petty Offenses/Infractions:** Petty offenses are the least serious criminal violations of Colorado state laws. Examples of petty offenses are third degree criminal trespass and littering of public or private property. Infractions relate only to very specific (not all) charges involving use and possession of marijuana and certain traffic violations. Infractions may be paid without making a court appearance.

<a name="enhancer"></a>**Sentence Enhancer**: Includes aggravated/repeat juvenile offender, habitual criminal, violent crime, and other sentence enhancers.

### Dispositions

<a name="dismissed"></a>**Dismissed**:  A case is dismissed when the criminal charges are terminated after the case is filed, either by the court or by the prosecutor. There can be several reasons for why a case is dismissed, including: a lack of evidence or unavailability of a witness as part of a plea agreement. This category also includes cases that are referred to diversion and successfully complete diversion programming.

<a name="pleadismissal"></a>**Plea Dismissal**: It is not uncommon for defendants to have multiple criminal cases going on at the same time. A defendant may be able to resolve such a situation by pleading guilty to some of the cases in exchange for others being dismissed. So, if a defendant pleads guilty to a case in exchange for the dismissal of two others, the case plead to would be categorized as plead guilty, whereas each of the cases dismissed would be categorized as “plea dismissals”.

<a name="diversion"></a>**Diversion:** Diversion is an alternative solution that can take many forms, but it usually involves a suspension of formal criminal proceedings against a defendant, where after completion of certain conditions (such as treatment that addresses the underlying causes of criminal behavior), the defendant has their charges dismissed. Diversion takes place pre-plea.

<a name="deferred"></a>**Deferred Judgment**: A deferred judgment is a temporary guilty plea. The defendant accepts responsibility such as service hours, probation, payment of restitution, or counseling or treatment related to their case. If they comply with the terms, their guilty plea is withdrawn and the case is dismissed. If they do not comply with the terms, then the case is reopened and subsequently sentenced. Deferred judgment is granted after a defendant takes a plea.

<a name="pleadguilty"></a>**Plead Guilty**: A defendant pleads guilty when they admit a factual basis for the plea and acknowledges guilt for a charge, sometimes in exchange for a more lenient sentence.

<a name="foundguilty"></a>**Found Guilty**: A defendant is found guilty when found guilty at trial of any charge.

<a name="acquitted"></a>**Acquitted**: A case is acquitted when a judge or jury at trial determines that the defendant is not guilty of the crime for which the individual has been charged.

<a name="violent"></a>**Violent Crime:** Violent Crime, as defined on the dashboard, includes charges categorized within the Crimes of Violence Statute  (18-1.3-406 ),  or is per se a Crime of Violence per case law. The definition includes attempted charges. Additionally, it includes Child Abuse resulting in Serious Bodily Injury (SBI) or Death.  For escape and extortion, given the wide range of potential charges, those charges are only included as a “violent crime” when the District Attorney has charged the case with a crime of violence sentence enhancer.

This definition of violent crime is used in the following indicators:

* Violent Victimization in Low-Income Communities
* Violent Victimization of Children
* Violent Victimization of People of Color

<a name="at-risk"></a>**At-Risk Elders:** Victims who are 70 years of age or older.

<a name="vra"></a>**The Victim Rights Act (VRA):**  A VRA case is one that provides constitutional protections for victims of certain [crimes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b9oBvGqYmdXYx2tVnCI-H4JKkz5SFE1X/view?usp=sharing) to be “heard when relevant, informed and present at all critical stages of the criminal justice process”. (Article 11, Section 16a of the Colorado State Constitution.)

### Demographics

<a name="ethnicity"></a>**Ethnicity**: For purposes of these indicators, ethnicity is defined as Hispanic or non-Hispanic.

<a name="race"></a>**Race**: Race is defined as the racial category as determined by law enforcement in the following categories: Hispanic, Black, American Indian, Asian, White, and Other.

Race and Ethnicity are captured separately in the DA’s case management system. Aligned with a person-centered approach, across the dashboard we have combined the two fields. If the individual is identified as Hispanic and White, they are categorized as Hispanic. If the individual’s race is logged as Black, they are categorized as Black regardless of their ethnicity.  If the individual’s race is logged as American Indian, they are categorized as American Indian regardless of their ethnicity. Individuals identified as having a race of Asian or Other, and an ethnicity of Non-Hispanic, are categorized as Another Race.

### Data Terms

<a name="average"></a>**Average**: The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the total number of values in the set. For example, to find the average of 24, 55, 17, 87 and 100, first find the sum of the numbers: 24 + 55 + 17 + 87 + 100 = 283 and divide by 5 to get 56.6.

<a name="median"></a>**Median:** The median is the value separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half. It may be thought of as the "middle" value of a data set. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth number in the sample. 

<a name="outlier"></a>**Outlier:** An outlier is a data point that differs from other observations, is much bigger or much smaller.

<a name="quintile"></a>**Quintile: ​​**A quintile is a statistical value of a data set that represents 20% of a given population, so the lowest quintile represents the lowest fifth of the data, while the upper quintile represents the highest fifth of the data.

### Methods

This dashboard aggregates data from the 1st District Attorney’s Office's Action case management system, stored and shared by the Colorado District Attorneys’ Council (CDAC).

To address issues of small sample size, the following measures were implemented:

1. Some data points are presented annually instead of quarterly.
2. When the quarterly measure is less than 20, we have taken a three month moving average. 
3. When the annual number is less than 20, we have excluded the metric.
