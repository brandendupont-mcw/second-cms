### Criminal Legal Terms

<a name="arrest"></a>**Arrest**: Law enforcement takes an individual into legal custody in response to the suspicion of an individual’s violation of the law. Law enforcement uses the standard of “probable cause” to determine whether an individual should be arrested, given information provided by witnesses or other evidence.

<a name="bail"></a>**Bail or bond:** The amount of money set by the court for the release of a person accused of a crime. It is designed to assure the person's presence for trial and may contain additional non-monetary conditions of release.

<a name="doubt"></a>**Beyond a reasonable doubt**: the legal burden of proof required to convict a defendant in a criminal case at trial. The prosecution bears the burden of proving that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt – in other words, that there is no other reasonable explanation that can come from the evidence presented.

<a name="bondhearing"></a>**Bond Hearing**: If in custody a bond hearing is held to provide argument, evidence, or testimony for the Court to use in determining an appropriate amount of bail to be set for a defendant.

<a name="case"></a>**Case**: A case is a collection of all charges against a defendant arising out of a single incident. In this dashboard, cases are classified by their most serious charge (the crime that a defendant is accused of committing).

<a name="custody"></a>**In custody:** When an individual is being detained by law enforcement, the court, or another legal entity and is not free to leave.

<a name="pleaagreement"></a>**Plea agreement**: an agreement between the prosecution and the defendant defining the specific conditions and crimes to which a defendant chooses to plead guilty.

### Charge Levels

<a name="felony"></a>**Felony**: Felonies are the most serious criminal violations of Colorado state laws (Colorado Revised Statutes), and include crimes such murder, rape, robbery, and manufacture and delivery of illegal drugs. In Colorado, felonies are divided into six classes, with Class 6 being the lowest level of felony and Class 1 the most serious, with prison sentences ranging from 12 months to life in prison. Sentences following conviction for a felony may include fines, probation, probation plus jail, community corrections, and prison. There are also four classes of drug felonies, with Class 4 being the lowest, and Class 1 the highest, with prison sentences ranging from 6 months to 32 years in prison.

<a name="misdemeanor"></a> **Misdemeanor**: Misdemeanors are less serious criminal violations of Colorado state laws, punishable by a sentence of up to 364 days in county jail. A person convicted of a misdemeanor cannot be sentenced to state prison, unless the misdemeanor sentence is served simultaneously (concurrently) with a felony sentence.  In Colorado, misdemeanor offenses are now divided into two classes, with Class 2 being the lowest level of misdemeanor and Class 1 the most serious. Misdemeanors cover a wide range of offenses, including crimes such as serious traffic offenses, alcohol-related traffic offenses (such as DUI and DWAI), careless driving resulting in injury or death, domestic violence, 3rd degree assault, 2nd degree forgery, indecent exposure, obstructing a police officer, theft less than $2,000, resisting arrest, criminal mischief with less than $2,000 damage, public fighting, prostitution and soliciting for prostitution, and underage drinking.

<a name="petty"></a>**Petty Offenses/Infractions:** Petty offenses are the least serious criminal violations of Colorado state laws. Examples of petty offenses are third degree criminal trespass and littering of public or private property.

<a name="enhancer"></a>**Sentence Enhancer**: Includes aggravated/repeat juvenile offender, habitual criminal, violent crime, and other sentence enhancers.

### Dispositions

<a name="dismissed"></a>**Dismissed**:  A case is dismissed when the criminal charges are terminated after the case is filed, either by the court or by the prosecutor. There can be several reasons for why a case is dismissed, including: a lack of evidence or unavailability of a witness as part of a plea agreement. This category also includes cases that are referred to diversion and successfully complete diversion programming.

<a name="pleadismissal"></a>**Plea Dismissal**: It is not uncommon for defendants to have multiple criminal cases going on at the same time. A defendant may be able to resolve such a situation by pleading guilty to some of the cases in exchange for others being dismissed. So, if a defendant pleads guilty to a case in exchange for the dismissal of two others, the case plead to would be categorized as plead guilty, whereas each of the cases dismissed would be categorized as “plea dismissals”.

<a name="diversion"></a>**Diversion:** Diversion is an alternative solution that can take many forms, but it usually involves a suspension of formal criminal proceedings against a defendant, where after completion of certain conditions (such as treatment that addresses the underlying causes of criminal behavior), the defendant has their charges dismissed. Diversion takes place pre-plea.

<a name="deferred"></a>**Deferred Judgment**: A deferred judgment is a temporary guilty plea. The defendant accepts responsibility such as service hours, probation, payment of restitution, or counseling or treatment related to their case. If they comply with the terms, their guilty plea is withdrawn and the case is dismissed. If they do not comply with the terms, then the case is reopened and subsequently sentenced. Deferred judgment is granted after a defendant takes a plea.

<a name="pleadguilty"></a>**Plead Guilty**: A defendant pleads guilty when they admit a factual basis for the plea and acknowledges guilt for a charge, sometimes in exchange for a more lenient sentence.

<a name="foundguilty"></a>**Found Guilty**: A defendant is found guilty when found guilty at trial of any charge.

<a name="acquitted"></a>**Acquitted**: A case is acquitted when a judge or jury at trial determines that the defendant is not guilty of the crime for which the individual has been charged.

### Demographics

<a name="age"></a>**Age**: Defendant and victim age is calculated at the time of the case is filed. 

<a name="gender"></a>**Gender**: Gender is defined as determined by law enforcement in the following categories: Male, Female, Other.

<a name="ethnicity"></a>**Ethnicity**: For purposes of these indicators, ethnicity is defined as Hispanic or non-Hispanic.

<a name="race"></a>**Race**: Race is defined as the racial category as determined by law enforcement in the following categories: Hispanic, Black, Native American, Asian, White, and Other.

Race and Ethnicity are captured separately in the DA’s case management system. Aligned with a person-centered approach, across the dashboard we have combined the two fields. If the individual is identified as Hispanic and White, they are categorized as Hispanic. If the individual’s race is logged as Black, they are categorized as Black regardless of their ethnicity.  If the individual’s race is logged as Native American, they are categorized as Native American regardless of their ethnicity. Individuals identified as having a race of Asian or Other, and an ethnicity of Non-Hispanic, are categorized as Another Race.

Given historical inequities in the justice system, in presenting metrics, we have chosen to compare outcomes for people of color (including Black, Hispanic, and Native American individuals) against White individuals. We hope this provides clear information on the presence/extent of differences by race/ethnicity. This is not meant to imply that the rate for White individuals is an appropriate benchmark. In addition, we have significantly less confidence that Hispanic individuals are accurately identified in the current dataset.

Some race/ethnic groups have small sample sizes. To address issues of small sample size, see measures taken in the <a href="/technical-notes#sample size">Methods</a> section below. 

### Data Terms

<a name="average"></a>**Average**: The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the total number of values in the set. For example, to find the average of 24, 55, 17, 87 and 100, first find the sum of the numbers: 24 + 55 + 17 + 87 + 100 = 283 and divide by 5 to get 56.6.

<a name="median"></a>**Median:** The median is the value separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half. It may be thought of as the "middle" value of a data set. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth number in the sample. 

<a name="outlier"></a>**Outlier:** An outlier is a data point that differs from other observations, is much bigger or much smaller.

<a name="quintile"></a>**Quintile: ​​**A quintile is a statistical value of a data set that represents 20% of a given population, so the lowest quintile represents the lowest fifth of the data, while the upper quintile represents the highest fifth of the data.

### Methods

This dashboard aggregates data from the Denver District Attorney Office's case management system, Action, stored and shared by the Colorado District Attorneys’ Council (CDAC).

<a name="sample size"></a> To address issues of small sample size, the following measures were implemented:

1. Some data points are presented annually instead of quarterly.
2. When the quarterly measure is less than 20, we have taken a three month moving average. 
3. When the annual number is less than 20, we have excluded the metric.

Criminal history and recidivism measures are limited in that they are calculated based on cases filed within the eight District Attorneys’ offices participating in the Colorado Prosecutorial Dashboards Project (the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 18th, and 20th). We do not have information on cases filed  outside these jurisdictions nor do the measures reflect cases from outside the state of Colorado. Criminal history relies on data since 2007. For these reasons, criminal history and recidivism may be underestimated. When benchmarked against data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, criminal history was found to be of similar magnitude.
