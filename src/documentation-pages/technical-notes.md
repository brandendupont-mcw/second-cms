### Criminal Legal Terms

<a name="arrest"></a>**Arrest**: Law enforcement takes an individual into legal custody in response to the suspicion of an individual’s violation of the law. Law enforcement uses the standard of “probable cause” to determine whether an individual should be arrested, given information provided by witnesses or other evidence.

<a name="bail"></a>**Bail or bond:** The amount of money set by the court for the release of a person accused of a crime. It is designed to assure the person's presence for trial and may contain additional non-monetary conditions of release.

<a name="doubt"></a>**Beyond a reasonable doubt**: the legal burden of proof required to convict a defendant in a criminal case at trial. The prosecution bears the burden of proving that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt – in other words, that there is no other reasonable explanation that can come from the evidence presented.

<a name="bondhearing"></a>**Bond Hearing**: If in custody a bond hearing is held to provide argument, evidence, or testimony for the Court to use in determining an appropriate amount of bail to be set for a defendant.

<a name="case"></a>**Case**: A case is a collection of all charges against a defendant arising out of a single incident. In this dashboard, cases are classified by their most serious charge (the crime that a defendant is accused of committing). 

<a name="crime"></a>**Crime**: An act prohibited by statute.

<a name="conviction"></a>**Conviction**: The outcome of criminal case when a  defendant is determined to be guilty of a crime. 

<a name="defendant"></a>**Defendant**: The person against whom a criminal case is pending.

<a name="filing"></a>**Filing a case**: Prosecutors review arrest reports/referrals for each felony case. If the prosecutor determines the evidence supports a good faith belief in conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, the case is filed and continues until resolution.

<a name="custody"></a>**In custody:** When an individual is being detained by law enforcement, the court, or another legal entity and is not free to leave.

<a name="pleaagreement"></a>**Plea agreement**: an agreement between the prosecution and the defendant defining the specific conditions and crimes to which a defendant chooses to plead guilty.

<a name="pretrial"></a>**Pretrial detention:** Defendants who are detained pretrial are incarcerated in jail prior to resolution of the case.

<a name="probable"></a>**Probable cause:** Evidentiary reason for arrest or to obtain a warrant. A reasonable basis for believing that a crime has been committed.

<a name="recidivism"></a>**Recidivism:**  For the purposes of our dashboard, defendants who recidivate are those who have a new criminal case (misdemeanor or felony) filed after case resolution. This might include a new law violation or a violation of a defendant’s term of probation.

<a name="referred"></a>**Referred:** A case is referred when it is submitted to the District  Attorney’s Office for review. This includes investigations, arrests, warrants, notices to appear, citations, and other requests for prosecution.

<a name="victim"></a>**Victim:** A victim is a person who has suffered direct or threatened physical psychological, or financial harm as a result of the commission or attempted commission of a crime.

### Charge Levels

<a name="felony"></a>**Felony**: Felonies are the most serious criminal violations of Colorado state laws (Colorado Revised Statutes), and include crimes such murder, rape, robbery, and manufacture and delivery of illegal drugs. In Colorado, felonies are divided into six classes, with Class 6 being the lowest level of felony and Class 1 the most serious, with prison sentences ranging from 12 months to life in prison. Sentences following conviction for a felony may include fines, probation, probation plus jail, community corrections, and prison. There are also four classes of drug felonies, with Class 4 being the lowest, and Class 1 the highest, with prison sentences ranging from 6 months to 32 years in prison.

<a name="misdemeanor"></a> **Misdemeanor**: Misdemeanors are less serious criminal violations of Colorado state laws, punishable by a sentence of up to 364 days in county jail. A person convicted of a misdemeanor cannot be sentenced to state prison, unless the misdemeanor sentence is served simultaneously (concurrently) with a felony sentence.  In Colorado, misdemeanor offenses are now divided into two classes, with Class 2 being the lowest level of misdemeanor and Class 1 the most serious. Misdemeanors cover a wide range of offenses, including crimes such as serious traffic offenses, alcohol-related traffic offenses (such as DUI and DWAI), careless driving resulting in injury or death, domestic violence, 3rd degree assault, 2nd degree forgery, indecent exposure, obstructing a police officer, theft less than $2,000, resisting arrest, criminal mischief with less than $2,000 damage, public fighting, prostitution and soliciting for prostitution, and underage drinking.

<a name="enhancer"></a>**Sentence Enhancer**: Includes aggravated/repeat juvenile offender, habitual criminal, violent crime, and other sentence enhancers.

### Dispositions

<a name="dismissed"></a>**Dismissed**:  A case is dismissed when the criminal charges are terminated after the case is filed, either by the court or by the prosecutor. There can be several reasons for why a case is dismissed, including: a lack of evidence or unavailability of a witness as part of a plea agreement. This category also includes cases that are referred to diversion and successfully complete diversion programming.

<a name="pleadismissal"></a>**Plea Dismissal**: It is not uncommon for defendants to have multiple criminal cases going on at the same time. A defendant may be able to resolve such a situation by pleading guilty to some of the cases in exchange for others being dismissed. So, if a defendant pleads guilty to a case in exchange for the dismissal of two others, the case plead to would be categorized as plead guilty, whereas each of the cases dismissed would be categorized as “plea dismissals”.

<a name="diversion"></a>**Diversion:** Diversion is an alternative solution that can take many forms, but it usually involves a suspension of formal criminal proceedings against a defendant, where after completion of certain conditions (such as treatment that addresses the underlying causes of criminal behavior), the defendant has their charges dismissed. Diversion takes place pre-plea.

<a name="deferred"></a>**Deferred Judgment**: A deferred judgment is a temporary guilty plea. The defendant accepts responsibility such as service hours, probation, payment of restitution, or counseling or treatment related to their case. If they comply with the terms, their guilty plea is withdrawn and the case is dismissed. If they do not comply with the terms, then the case is reopened and subsequently sentenced. Deferred judgment is granted after a defendant takes a plea.

<a name="pleadguilty"></a>**Plead Guilty**: A defendant pleads guilty when they admit a factual basis for the plea and acknowledges guilt for a charge, sometimes in exchange for a more lenient sentence.

<a name="foundguilty"></a>**Found Guilty**: A defendant is found guilty when found guilty at trial of any charge.

<a name="acquitted"></a>**Acquitted**: A case is acquitted when a judge or jury at trial determines that the defendant is not guilty of the crime for which the individual has been charged.

### <a name="demographics"></a>Demographics

<a name="age"></a>**Age**: Defendant and victim age is calculated at the time of the case is filed. 

<a name="gender"></a>**Gender**: Gender is defined as determined by law enforcement in the following categories: Male, Female, Other.

<a name="ethnicity"></a>**Ethnicity**: For purposes of these indicators, ethnicity is defined as Hispanic or non-Hispanic.

<a name="race"></a>**Race**: Race is defined as the racial category as determined by law enforcement in the following categories: Hispanic, Black, Native American, Asian, White, and Other.

Race and Ethnicity are captured separately in the DA’s case management system. Aligned with a person-centered approach, across the dashboard we have combined the two fields. If the individual is identified as Hispanic and White, they are categorized as Hispanic. If the individual’s race is logged as Black, they are categorized as Black regardless of their ethnicity.  If the individual’s race is logged as Native American, they are categorized as Native American regardless of their ethnicity. Individuals identified as having a race of Other, and an ethnicity of Non-Hispanic, are categorized as Another Race. Because we believe that Hispanic individuals are systematically miscategorized as White in the dataset, we use the defendant’s last name to help identify their ethnicity. Based on procedures employed by the Colorado Department of Public Safety in their [CLEAR Act reporting](https://ors.colorado.gov/ors-sb185), we recategorized any individual as Hispanic who met the following criteria: 1) their race was identified as “White,” “other,” or their race was missing and 2) the 2010 census file ([surnames occurring 100 or more times](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2010_surnames.html)) identified their surname as having 85% or more individuals with that surname as “Hispanic or Latino”.

Given historical inequities in the justice system, in presenting metrics, we have chosen to compare outcomes for people of color (including Black, Hispanic, and Native American individuals) against White individuals. We hope this provides clear information on the presence/extent of differences by race/ethnicity. This is not meant to imply that the rate for White individuals is an appropriate benchmark. 

Some race/ethnic groups have small sample sizes. To address issues of small sample size, see measures taken in the <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#sample size">Methods</a> section below. 

The <a href="/2nd/defendant_characteristics#census">District Population, by Race/Ethnicity 2020 Census</a> was generated from information publicly available through the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/colorado-population-change-between-census-decade.html#:~:text=Population%20(up%207.4%25%20to%20331.4,or%20More%20Races%2010.2%25).). In 2020 the U.S. Census collected race and ethnicity as two questions: one for ethnicity, “Hispanic or Latino” and “Not Hispanic or Latino”, and another for race with six categories: “White,” “Black or African American,” “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian”, “Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander”, and “Some Other Race”. To best compare the general population to the population of individuals with criminal cases filed, we have used similar logic to categorize individuals. If the individual is identified as Hispanic and White, they are categorized as Hispanic. If the individual’s race is logged as Black, they are categorized as Black regardless of their ethnicity.  If the individual’s race is logged as Native American (“American Indian or Alaska Native” or “Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander”) they are categorized as Native American regardless of their ethnicity. Individuals categorized as “Some Other Race” and Hispanic are categorized as Hispanic. Individuals that selected two or more races, regardless of their ethnicity, are categorized in the “Multiracial or Another Race” category.

### Data Terms

<a name="average"></a>**Average**: The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the total number of values in the set. For example, to find the average of 24, 55, 17, 87 and 100, first find the sum of the numbers: 24 + 55 + 17 + 87 + 100 = 283 and divide by 5 to get 56.6.

<a name="median"></a>**Median:** The median is the value separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half. It may be thought of as the "middle" value of a data set. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth number in the sample. 

<a name="outlier"></a>**Outlier:** An outlier is a data point that differs from other observations, is much bigger or much smaller.

<a name="quintile"></a>**Quintile: ​​**A quintile is a statistical value of a data set that represents 20% of a given population, so the lowest quintile represents the lowest fifth of the data, while the upper quintile represents the highest fifth of the data.

**Defendant Median Household Income**: As a socioeconomic proxy, 2020 Census data was used to determine the median household income of the zip code where the defendant is reported to reside. We limited the defendant zip code to defendants convicted of felonies with Colorado addresses. We categorized the zip codes into quintiles, and compared the highest income quintile to the lowest income quintile. This socioeconomic proxy is used in:  

* <a href="/2nd/sentencing#felony incarceration">Felony Incarceration Differences by Socioeconomic Status - Median Household Income</a>

**Victim Median Household Income:** As a socioeconomic proxy, 2020 Census data was used to determine the median household income of the zip code where the victim is reported to reside. We limited the victim zip code to victims of felonies with Colorado addresses. We categorized the zip codes into quintiles, and compared the  highest income quintile to the lowest income quintile. This socioeconomic proxy is used in:

* <a href="/2nd/serving_victims#personsex">Person and Sex Offense Dismissals Across Socioeconomic Status</a>
* <a href="/2nd/serving_victims#property">Property Offense Dismissals Across Socioeconomic Status</a>

### Methods

This dashboard aggregates data from the Denver District Attorney Office's case management system, Action, stored and shared by the Colorado District Attorneys’ Council (CDAC).

<a name="indicators"></a> We present data in eight sections, summarizing information about different parts of the prosecution process. In each section we present: 

1. General trends, an overview of cases and characteristics 
2. Indicators, selected from the menu of 55 [Prosecutorial Performance Indicators](https://prosecutorialperformanceindicators.org/) (PPIs), which are designed to measure capacity and efficiency, community safety and well-being, and fairness and justice. PPIs offer an array of metrics that can be tracked over time to inform decision making and policy development.

<a name="sample size"></a> To address issues of small sample size, we implemented the following measures:

1. Presented some data points annually instead of quarterly.
2. When the quarterly measure was less than 20, we took a three month moving average. 
3. When the annual number was less than 20, we excluded the metric.

Criminal history and recidivism measures are limited in that they are calculated based on cases filed (for recidivism) and cases convicted (for criminal history) within the District Attorneys’ offices participating in the [Colorado Prosecutorial Dashboards Project](https://coloradolab.org/colorado-prosecutorial-dashboards/). We do not have information on cases filed  outside these jurisdictions nor do the measures reflect cases from outside the state of Colorado. Criminal history relies on data since 2007. For these reasons, criminal history and recidivism may be underestimated. When benchmarked against data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, criminal history was found to be of similar magnitude.

### Methodological Updates

**February 2023**

*Case Resolutions.* Cases disposed with a disposition reason “deceased defendant” were excluded from case resolution related charts.

*Number of Hearings.* Hearings that occurred after case resolution (for e.g., if a defendant was on probation or returned to court for some reason after the case was disposed) were excluded from the average number of hearings per case.

*Ethnicity Correction.* In benchmarking against the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice we found that individuals identified as Hispanic are underreported in the data from the case management system. Therefore, we used defendants’ last names to better identify Hispanic individuals. Based on procedures employed by the Colorado Department of Public Safety in their [CLEAR Act reporting](https://ors.colorado.gov/ors-sb185), we recategorized any individual as Hispanic who met the following criteria: 1) their race was identified as “White,” “other,” or their race was missing and 2) the 2010 census file ([surnames occurring 100 or more times](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2010_surnames.html)) identified their surname as having 85% or more individuals with that surname as “Hispanic or Latino.”
