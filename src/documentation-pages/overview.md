# **Overview**

### **Why did we develop this dashboard?**

In developing this dashboard, we seek to provide the community with insight in to our work through:

* **Transparency.** Ensuring that we are providing visibility into the processes, procedures and outcomes of our work to the community.
* **Efficiency.** Ensuring that we are using resources wisely and being good stewards of public funding.
* **Community Safety and Well-Being.** Ensuring that we are addressing serious crime and protecting and serving the community and victims of crime.
* **Justice and Fairness.** Ensuring that at each point of prosecutorial discretion, all decisions are fair, balanced and unbiased for all victims and defendants.
* **Data-driven Decision-making.** Ensuring that we use data to make improvements to the Office processes and procedures.

### How can you use this dashboard?

You can use this dashboard to understand the work that the DA's Office does. You can use it to look at trends in cases filed and resolved over time and patterns in how individuals are treated. The charts show key decision points and the data stories provide a deep dive into specific issues addressed by the DA’s Office.  

The dashboard is organized in eight sections, many of which mirror the “flow” of a <a href="/criminal-justice-process#CJ Process">case</a>[](https://colorado-test-cms.netlify.app/criminal-justice-process)[](https://colorado-test-cms.netlify.app/criminal-justice-process). No one data point provides *all* the information you may need; therefore, it is important to look at different data points in relation to one another. In general, dashboards are good at helping identify *what* is happening – understanding the *why* behind trends and patterns requires deeper investigation.
