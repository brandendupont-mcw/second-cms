# **Overview**

### **Why did we develop this dashboard?**

**\[Insert video/letter etc.]**

The dashboard seeks to support:

* **Transparency.** Ensuring that the DA’s Office is communicating what it is doing and the outcomes of its work.
* **Efficiency.** Ensuring that the DA’s Office is using resources wisely and being good stewards of public funding.
* **Community Safety and Well-Being.** Ensuring that the DA’s Office is addressing serious crime and protecting and serving victims.
* **Justice and Fairness.** Ensuring that the DA’s Office is identifying and prioritizing actions to reduce disparities at points of prosecutorial discretion and to ensure the fair treatment of victims and defendants.
* **Data-driven Decision-making.** Ensuring that the DA’s Office is learning what is going well and where there is room for improvement, ensuring decisions are grounded in systematically collected data.

### How can you use this dashboard?

You can use this dashboard to understand the work that the DA's Office does. You can use it to look at trends in cases filed and resolved over time and patterns in how individuals are treated. The charts show key decision points and the data stories provide a deep dive into specific issues addressed by the DA’s Office.  

The dashboard is organized in eight sections, many of which mirror the “flow” of a <a href="/criminal-justice-process#CJ Process">case</a>[](https://colorado-test-cms.netlify.app/criminal-justice-process)[](https://colorado-test-cms.netlify.app/criminal-justice-process). No one data point provides *all* the information you may need; therefore, it is important to look at different data points in relation to one another. In general, dashboards are good at helping identify *what* is happening – understanding the *why* behind trends and patterns requires deeper investigation.
