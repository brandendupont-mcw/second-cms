# <a name="CJ Process"></a>Criminal Justice Process

Colorado’s criminal justice system is a collaboration between many actors. The DA’s Office prosecutes cases, provides assistance to victims and witnesses of crime, and oversees alternative programming such as diversion and restorative justice.

* When there is an incident or alleged crime, law enforcement investigates and determines if a person committed a crime. Incidents involving <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> charges are directly filed by law enforcement. Incidents involving <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#felony">felony</a> charges are referred to the DA’s Office, which decides whether to file or decline the case. 
* If there is no arrest, the individual receives a summons, which is a request to appear in court on a certain date. If there is an <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#arrest">arrest</a>, the <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#bail">bond</a> amount and bond requirements are decided at the bond hearing. Although the prosecutor and defense attorney can provide recommendations, bond is set by a judicial officer.
* There are five primary ways a case can be resolved: (1) the case can be <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#dismissed">dismissed</a>, (2) the individual can be referred to a <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#diversion">diversion</a> program, (3) the individual can <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#pleadguilty">plead guilty</a> and enter in to a <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#pleaagreement">plea agreement</a>, (4) the individual can plead guilty and receive a <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#deferred">deferred judgment</a>, or (5) the individual can plead not guilty and go to trial (where they are either <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#foundguilty">found guilty</a> or <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#acquitted">acquitted</a>).
* If the individual successfully completes a diversion program or a deferred judgment, the case is dismissed. If the individual does not successfully complete either program, the case returns to court. 
* If the individual pleads guilty or is found guilty at trial they are sentenced.
