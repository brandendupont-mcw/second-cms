# <a name="CJ Process"></a>Criminal Justice Process

Colorado’s criminal justice system is a collaboration between lawmakers, law enforcement, prosecutors from the Denver District Attorney’s (DA) Office, private and public defense attorneys, judges, and the community. The Denver DA’s Office prosecutes cases, provides assistance to victims and witnesses of crime, and oversees alternative programming such as diversion and restorative justice.

This  <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/10HwZcGTyM-EVg8tFvGdS-QcpV86kmSNg/view?usp=sharing'> Flowchart</a> shows how cases “flow” through the criminal justice system. 

* When there is an incident or alleged crime, law enforcement investigates and determines if a person committed a crime. Incidents involving <a href="/technical-notes#misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> charges or <a href="/technical-notes#petty">petty offenses/infractions</a> are directly filed by law enforcement. Incidents involving <a href="/technical-notes#felony">felony</a> charges are referred to the DA’s Office, which decides whether to file or decline the case. 
* In Denver, there are two separate prosecutorial agencies. The Denver District Attorney and the Denver City Attorney. Generally, the Denver District Attorney prosecutes state felonies and misdemeanors, and the Denver City Attorney, prosecutes municipal violations.  
* If there is no arrest, the individual receives a summons - a request to appear in court on a certain date. If there is an <a href="/technical-notes#arrest">arrest</a>, the <a href="/technical-notes#bail">bond</a> will be decided at the bond hearing. Although the prosecutor can provide recommendations, bond is set by a judge, not by law enforcement or the DA's Office. 
* There are five primary ways a case can be resolved: (1) the case can be <a href="/technical-notes#dismissed">dismissed</a>, (2) the individual can be referred to a <a href="/technical-notes#diversion">diversion</a> program, (3) the individual can <a href="/technical-notes#pleadguilty">plead guilty</a> and enter in to a <a href="/technical-notes#pleaagreement">plea agreement</a>, (4) the individual can plead guilty and receive a <a href="/technical-notes#deferred">deferred judgment</a>, or (5) the individual can plead not guilty and go to trial (where they are either <a href="/technical-notes#foundguilty">found guilty</a> or <a href="/technical-notes#acquitted">acquitted</a>).
* If the individual successfully completes a diversion program or a deferred judgment, the case is dismissed. If the individual does not successfully complete either program, the case returns to court. 
* If the individual pleads guilty or is found guilty at trial they are sentenced.

### What does the DA’s Office do?

* Issues warrants for arrest. 
* Makes recommendations for bond.
* Screens and decides whether to charge felony cases referred from law enforcement.
* Conducts outreach and provides resources to victims.
* Screens defendants for diversion or other alternatives to prosecution.
* Dismisses or amends charges after filing.
* Makes plea offers.
* Makes sentencing recommendations.

### What does the DA’s Office not do?

* Arrests individuals. Law enforcement arrests and refers individuals upon probable cause of offense.
* Sets bond. The judge makes the decision on the bond set. 
* Imposes sentences. The judge imposes a sentence following conviction.
