# Felony Referrals

A felony referral to the Denver District Attorney's (DA) Office occurs when law enforcement, typically the Denver Police Department, presents an individual suspected of a felony crime to review for potential charges, generally following an <a href="/technical-notes#arrest">arrest</a>. This section presents data on <a href="/technical-notes#felony">felony</a> cases referred by law enforcement agencies to the Denver DA’s Office for review. The Denver DA’s Office decides whether to file charges – a formal accusation that a specific person has committed a specific crime – based on the evidence and reasonable likelihood of <a href="/technical-notes#conviction">conviction</a>. 

**Why is this important?**  The Denver DA’s Office makes decisions based on the <a href="/technical-notes#case">cases</a> they receive from law enforcement; they are not responsible for arresting or citing individuals. The office may decide not to file a case for a number of reasons, such as insufficient evidence or investigation by law enforcement, when the charges did not rise to the level of a crime, or acceptance into a pre-charge <a href="/technical-notes#diversion">diversion</a> program.

## Indicators

Below are a set of indicators that provide additional context about felony referrals. These indicators help the Denver DA's Office ensure we maximize government resources by making strategic decisions about which cases to accept for prosecution.

**Notes:**

* Each <a href="/technical-notes#referred">referral</a> is represented once. 
* Warrants are excluded (for all cases identified as a warrant).
* <a href="/technical-notes#misdemeanor">Misdemeanor</a> cases are directly charged and filed by the law enforcement agency; the Denver DA does not review these cases prior to charging. The Denver DA’s Office can dismiss misdemeanor cases (see <a href="/case_resolution#">Case Resolution</a>[](https://colorado-test-cms.netlify.app/case_resolution) dashboard). 
* Law enforcement arrests and charges are based on a <a href="/technical-notes#probable">probable cause</a> standard of proof, whereas the Denver DA’s Office charges based on proof <a href="/technical-notes#doubt">beyond a reasonable doubt</a>.
