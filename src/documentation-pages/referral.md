# Felony Referrals

A felony referral to the  DA's Office occurs when law enforcement presents an individual suspected of a felony crime to review for potential charges, generally following an <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#arrest">arrest</a>. This section presents data on <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#felony">felony</a> cases referred by law enforcement agencies to the DA’s Office for review. The DA’s Office decides whether to file charges – a formal accusation that a specific person has committed a specific crime – based on the evidence and reasonable likelihood of <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#conviction">conviction</a>. 

**Why is this important?**  The DA’s Office makes decisions based on the <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#case">cases</a> they receive from law enforcement; they are not responsible for arresting or citing individuals. The office may decide not to file a case for a number of reasons, such as insufficient evidence or investigation by law enforcement, when the charges did not rise to the level of a crime, or acceptance into a  <a href="/2nd/technical-notes#diversion">diversion</a> program.

**The Denver DA's Office is working to collect and publish data for felony referrals. Please revisit this site in the future.**
